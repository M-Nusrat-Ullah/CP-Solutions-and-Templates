    I found a bug during my gameplay.
    When I finished World Quest "Gourmet Supremos, Assemble!", next at the same location the three NPC's were standing with a world quest mark over their head. When I started talking each of NPC's had two bodies and when they finished talking the World Quest "The Gourmet Supremos: The Seashore Strider" begun. I instantly found myself at a different location far away from before and the three NPC's were there too.
    I have some screenshots with the bug but for some reason I don't know why, I can't send them through here. Should I send them by any different method?
